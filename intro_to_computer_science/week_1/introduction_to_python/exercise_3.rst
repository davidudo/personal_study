Week 1 (Exercise 3)
===================

1. True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely
   one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.

   Answer
   ------
   False

2. True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation,
   by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.

   Answer
   ------
   False

3. A program counter

   Answer
   ------
   counts the number of primitive operations executed by the program.

4. What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence
   executing some computation"?

   Answer
   ------
   The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except
   sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.

5. True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every
   computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.

   Answer
   ------
   False. Alan Turing proved that all problems can be computed with only 6
   primitives!
